## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

**Q: Why create another network tool when macOS has built-in utilities?**  
A: Netty provides a unified, user-friendly interface that combines multiple network tools with better output formatting and additional features like geolocation and speed testing.

**Q: Does this require administrator permissions?**  
A: Most features work without sudo. Only DNS cache flushing requires administrator permissions, and the tool will prompt when needed.

**Q: Can I use this on corporate/managed networks?**  
A: Yes! Netty only uses read-only operations for most features and doesn't modify network settings without explicit user action.

**Q: How accurate are the speed test results?**  
A: Speed tests use real file downloads from reliable CDNs and ping multiple servers for accuracy. Results should be within 10-15% of dedicated speed testing tools.

**Q: Can I automate this tool in scripts?**  
A: Absolutely! Use the `--quiet` flag for minimal output and check exit codes. Many commands are designed for script integration.

**Q: What makes this different from other network tools?**  
A: Netty focuses on ease of use, beautiful output, comprehensive logging, and macOS-specific optimizations while remaining lightweight and fast.
